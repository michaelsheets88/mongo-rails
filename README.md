# My Mongoid + Rails sandbox

## Trying to get good at Nosql

NoSql sounds great to me in theory, but I have such a hard time doing anything besides the most simple of projects with it.  This project is also there to help me learn more about Rails without ActiveRecord.

The beginnings of this little project started from [Rich on Rails](https://richonrails.com/articles/mongodb-and-rails), and hopefully I can use it as a guide to make this a little bigger and use this learn some more stuff about reporting and data manipulation in NoSql.
